# digimon-rearise-js

This is a collection of programs that we use to run Digimon-ReArise related programs. It is comprised of two main projects:

  * `digimon-rearise-bots` which is a bot that runs the Mon bot on Discord.
  * `digimon-rearise-server` is a reverse-engineered server that runs the game's code.
  
## Getting Started

This repository has been configured to run with both VSCode and JetBrains WebStorm. Be sure to also read the *README.md*(s) in each project's respective folder.

1. Install node modules (`npm i`) in both the bot and the server (if you're working on it).
2. Follow each project's *Getting Started* in their respective *README.md* file.
